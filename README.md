#TODO: get Monica to review and update following text

## Purpose of this pattern

Globally Regulators are increasing their focus on *Resiliency*, for example the UK Operational Resiliency and the European Digital Operations Resiliency Act (DORA).

These regulations focus on the following five areas:

1. Enhanced Risk Management: for example Business Continuity, Disaster Rocovery Planning and Cyber Risk Detection
2. Incident Management and Reporting: NIS2 
3. Digital Operations Resilince Testing: for example penetration testing, concentration risk
4. Third Part ICT Risks
5. Exit Strategy: including testing and war gaming

The purpsoe of this Pattern is to provide a codified architecture that can be used to address some of the use cases that can be addressed using Red Hat and Cloud Native Technologies

## Patter Use Cases

# Enhanced Risk Management

1. Apply, remediate and report on compliance controls. This pattern applies the [CIS] {https://downloads.cisecurity.org/#/} benchmark.  

# Incident Management and Reporting

# Digital Operations Resilince Testing

# Third Part ICT Risks

# Exit Strategy
