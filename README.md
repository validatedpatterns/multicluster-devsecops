This is a WIP project to develop an Operational-Resilience Vaidated Pattern.  

To contribute fork main / create a new branch and open a PR to contribute back.

#TODO: get Monica to review and update following text

## Purpose of this pattern

Globally Regulators are increasing their focus on *Resiliency*, for example the UK Operational Resiliency and the European Digital Operations Resiliency Act (DORA).

These regulations focus on the following five areas:

1. *Enhanced Risk Management*: for example Business Continuity, Disaster Rocovery Planning and Cyber Risk Detection
2. *Incident Management and Reporting*: NIS2 
3. *Digital Operations Resilince Testing*: for example penetration testing, concentration risk
4. *Third Part ICT Risks*
5. *Exit Strategy*: including testing and war gaming

The purpsoe of this Pattern is to provide a codified architecture that can be used to address some of the use cases that can be addressed using Red Hat and Cloud Native Technologies

## Pattern Use Cases

### Enhanced Risk Management

1. Apply cross-cluster governance and application lifecycle management
2. Apply, remediate and report on compliance controls. This pattern applies the [CIS] {https://downloads.cisecurity.org/#/} benchmark
3. Securely manage secrets across the deployment
4. CI/CD pipelines with security gates e.g. image scanning, signing and secure image storage
5. Advanced securing monitoring and alerting

### Incident Management and Reporting

### Digital Operations Resilince Testing

1. GitOps approach to control configuration and operations
2. Centrally manage multiple clusters, including workloads

### Third Part ICT Risks

### Exit Strategy

### Todo: continue to update as patter develops. 

1. GitOps approach to manage hybrid and multi-cloud deployments across both private and public cloud
2. 


## Usecase demostrations

1. Managed and Secured: a more controlled environment
2. Development: where AppDev: Testing etc is happening
3. Central Data Centre / Hub: the cloud / core

### Todo: add demo for GitOps and resilience pattern
